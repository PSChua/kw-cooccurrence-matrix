Experimental cooccurrence matrix for a set of keywords.
:::
Code takes in a UTF-8 csv of a one-column list of all your keywords. It then outputs 3 files of your choice:
-> a normalised cooccurrence data (min-max)
-> a binary cooccurrence data (1 if above threshold)
-> a raw cooccurrence
:::
All csv are semicolon-separated. Reason for this is for Gephi graphing purposes.
